    Homework 1
    

## Changes I made:

-	Modified the HTML file to make it more human readable.
-	Ordered classes and Idâ€™s to avoid redundancies and make them easy to identify on the CSS file.
-	Regroup classes with the same property to have less selectors on the CSS file.
-	Fixed the header links to redirect you to the correct part of the site.
-	I left the code as clean as I could.
